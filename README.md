Project Idea: Closet Application to See Items and Build Outfits

This project is an IOS application developed in Swift. The app uses persistent file and setting database storage and allows users to add images of items in their closet, along with an image of their head to see and page though virtual previews of any outfit combination possible. Users can save their favorite outfits for future reference and manage saved outfits, as well as individual closet items.
